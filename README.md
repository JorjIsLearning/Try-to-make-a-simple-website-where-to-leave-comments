# I try to make a site where to leave comments

I want to make a simple site where people can leave comments about their good ideas. I want this to be written only in html, css and js.

After somebody write his comment and push the button "Leave a comment" I would that text to be shown below comment box in up to down order.

I do not want to put their name, email or anything else as a rule to make a comment.

I do not want the comments to have details about the date, time, author etc about when the comment occured.

I do know how to do all this things, but I try. I do not to do the function in js to do these.
